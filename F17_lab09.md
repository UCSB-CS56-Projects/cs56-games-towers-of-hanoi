disks,from the most ever solved down to the least, with the name of the person, and the date/time that they got that score.The leaderboard should be saved between runs of the program and should be accessible from the starting menu.

* Issue #73 Walk through tutorial (200 PTS) 

Add a walk through tutorial of the game by walking the user through the game step by step in a game with three disks. The tutorial would not "win" the game, but instead challenge the user to accomplish that after the tutorial is finished.

* Issue # Add more textures and add highlight when selected (150 ?) 

The latest update allows for only three textures to be chosen. Adding a wider variety of interesting picture-based graphics would still be nice. Additionally, after the current update, there is no highlight when the blocks are selected. Adding this highlight would make the game easier for the users.  

* Issue # Create GUI for saving files (150 ?) 
The Latest update allows the user to make multiple saves, and load from three saves. Create a GUI that allows the user to make more the 3 saves and name their own files they are writing to.
