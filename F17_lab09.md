disks,from the most ever solved down to the least, with the name of the person, and the date/time that they got that score.The leaderboard should be saved between runs of the program and should be accessible from the starting menu.

* Issue #73 Walk through tutorial (200 PTS) 

Add a walk through tutorial of the game by walking the user through the game step by step in a game with three disks. The tutorial would not "win" the game, but instead challenge the user to accomplish that after the tutorial is finished.

* Issue #77 Add more textures and add highlight when selected 150 pts

The latest update allows for only three textures to be chosen. Adding a wider variety of interesting picture-based graphics would still be nice. Additionally, after the current update, there is no highlight when the blocks are selected. Adding this highlight would make the game easier for the users.
